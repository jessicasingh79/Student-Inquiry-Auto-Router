_Title_: **Student Inquiry Auto-Router**

_Problem_: Universities receive 50-200 contact form submissions daily across multiple departments. Manual triage takes staff 20+ minutes per day and inquiries sit unanswered for hours.
_Solution_: n8n workflow that receives form data via webhook, classifies by inquiry type (Financial Aid, Admissions, IT Support), routes to department-specific Airtable tables, and sends instant confirmation emails to students.
_Impact_: Eliminates manual routing, provides instant acknowledgment to students, reduces first response time from 4-6 hours to < 1 minute.

**Tech Stack**: n8n, Airtable, Gmail API, Webhook
